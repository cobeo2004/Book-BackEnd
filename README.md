### Book RESTful API Practice Project 

Yo lads and gents,

This project is a small and also acts as a sub-project for the main project, which is _Old Kingdom Food Ordering_ - **https://github.com/cobeo2004/Old-Kingdom-Food-Ordering/tree/master**. Throughout this project, I have learnt how to create a RESTful API and use some basic stuffs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) in order to interact with API. This is an essential knowledge that I will apply to my project !

This project is heavily archived from _Tạo REST API cơ bản với Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Postman(2022)_ **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3y1jYPbr4**

Cheers,
Simon Nguyen
